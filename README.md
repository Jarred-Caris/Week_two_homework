Building a responsive portfolio

## Week two home work project

For our week 2 project, we were tasked with building a responsive portfolio page for ourselves from scratch. We were to utilize the techniques we learnt previously. This project had a heavy emphasis on using bootstrap to quicken our code writing but also add features quickly and efficiently seen on most web pages. We also needed our page to be able to adapt to different screen sizes for use on computers, tablets, mobile phones, etc.

## This is the end result

## My contribution

I Really enjoyed the week 2 project as it allowed us to build a site from scratch. Coming of the back of debugging existing code, it allowed me to look at how i would achievee this in different ways as well as how to write better code.

In the project, we were asked to create a responsive portfolio website for ourselves with 3 seperate pages. An about me page with personal information and a profile picture, a portfolio page which in future, will house my projects and a contact page where people can reach out to me in a number of ways. The page also needed to be responsive on different screen sizes which is vital in this day and age.

Bootstrap was a major part of this project as it allowed us to create more complex features with ease. we used the grid page layout, using rows and columns to position page features.

**explaining my page**
With my page, i elected to go for a darker colour scheme. I played around with more vibrant looks but i feel if this page is a representation of me, the cool and calm look achieved with the blacks, greys and silvers felt more comfortable to me.

My about me is a brief but detailed look into my life. My working history and why i chose to learn coding. A list of my hobbies and outside work details. And a short dive into my personal life.

My portfolio page i created using placeholder images. As the course progresses, i will update this section with my projects. i have created 8 slots but will add to if needed in the future.

With my contact page, I implemented something I see on most web pages. I Have included multiple contact methods, each with its own activation button. The "contact me by phone" button is attached to my personal number. The "contact me by email" button will open a users email system with my email attachd. The "Github" link is linked to my week 2 github homework page.
