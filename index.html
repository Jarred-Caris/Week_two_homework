            My name is Jarred Caris.
            <br />
            I am a future web developer in the making, currently undertaking a 6
            month intensive coding bootcamp. I have spent over 15 years in the
            customer service and sales industry and looking for a drastic career
            change. My love for technology and my creative mindset made web
            development the most logical and exciting pathway for me.
            <br />
            Outside of my professional career, I have a range of hobbies. I have
            played drums for over 15 years and dabbled in a range of other
            musical instruments. Im an avid video gamer, playing since I was 4
            years old. Prior to making the decision to study coding, I was
            teaching myself 3d animation, special effects and 3d modelling. I
            have been an artist for as long as i can remember, usually prefering
            pencil and paper but always exploring new ways to put my ideas into
            the real world. I love the beach and in my younger days, alot of
            time was spent their with my friends surfing, body boarding and just
            enjoying the atmosphere
            <br />
            <br />
            I have been with my partner for over 4 years now. We got engaged in
            2019 and have lived together for most of our relationship. We have 2
            pugs named Nala and Pablo who, while annoying sometimes, provide the
            house with alot of laughs. We spend alot of time seing our family
            and friends. We are also very passionate about playing pool and
            darts. this takes up alot of our spare time and has becoming a long
            running competition in the household.
